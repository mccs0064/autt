        and supersedes any prior written or oral agreement between us relating to it and the Parties confirm that they have not entered into this agreement on the basis of any

at any time subsequently to exercise such rights and remedies or to enforce all terms of this
Agreement.

<h4>13. Force majeure</h4>
We shall have no liability under or be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement for any delays or
failures in performance of this Agreement which result from circumstances beyond our reasonable
